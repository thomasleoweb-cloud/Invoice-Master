## Invoice Builder
- Develop a responsive invoice generation application using React JS that allows users to create and manage invoices dynamically. Users should be able to enter client information, add multiple line items, calculate totals and taxes automatically, and export the invoice as a PDF. The app should maintain invoice data in the local state and provide a printable layout.
